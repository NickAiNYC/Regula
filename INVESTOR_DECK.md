## 1. The Problem: $50B+ Annual Revenue Leakage

### Healthcare providers are losing billions to systematic underpayments

**Key Statistics:**
- **35-45%** of behavioral health claims systematically underpaid
- **$50B+** annual underpayment across US healthcare system
- **Average provider** loses $127K-$450K annually
- **Manual processes** catch <10% of violations
- **Current solutions** are reactive, not preventive

### Why Providers Can't Fix This Themselves

❌ **Complexity**: 1,000+ payers × 50 states × 10,000+ CPT codes = 500M+ rate combinations  
❌ **No Visibility**: Providers don't know what they should be paid  
❌ **Resource Constraints**: Manual review costs $75-150 per claim  
❌ **Payer Sophistication**: Insurance companies use AI to minimize payments  
❌ **Regulatory Complexity**: Different mandates per state/payer/service
