## Risk Mitigation

### Market Risks

**Mitigation**: Diversify across Medicare, commercial payers; expand beyond parity

**Risk**: Payer pushback, lobbying against enforcement  
**Mitigation**: Build provider coalition, engage regulators, media coverage

### Competitive Risks

**Risk**: Epic/Cerner builds competing feature  
**Mitigation**: Partner with them first; our AI/ML is years ahead

**Risk**: Copycat startups  
**Mitigation**: Data moat (10M+ claims), regulatory expertise, speed to market

### Execution Risks

**Risk**: Sales cycle longer than expected  
**Mitigation**: Strong PLG motion, focus on SMB (faster sales cycle)

**Risk**: Customer acquisition costs too high  
**Mitigation**: Optimize digital channels, build referral program, partner ecosystem
